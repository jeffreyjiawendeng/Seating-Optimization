## Algorithm Consistency Fixes

### Before (Inconsistent Problem Formulation)
- **Greedy**: Used `avg_brightness >= threshold` 
- **ILP**: Used `sum(brightness) >= threshold * group_size`
- **Result**: Algorithms solved different problems ❌

### After (Consistent Problem Formulation)
- **Both algorithms**: Use `sum(brightness) >= threshold * group_size`
- **Result**: Fair comparison of identical problems ✅

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

1. **Pre-computed Table Statistics** (`data/table_stats.csv`)
   - Eliminates repeated calculations during greedy selection
   - Reduces algorithm overhead significantly

2. **Pre-computed Adjacency Graph** (`data/adjacency_graph.csv`) 
   - Optimized generation: O(n²) → O(n²/2) with symmetry
   - Faster adjacency lookups for constraint validation

3. **Efficient Data Loading**
   - `load_optimized_data()` function for streamlined data access
   - Proper file path handling with `os.path.join()`

4. **Limited Search Space** 
   - Greedy algorithm uses bounded search to maintain speed
   - Exhaustive search samples top candidates efficiently
